Defensive Tools For The Blind (DTFTB) is a collection of Windows and Linux tools that automate: post exploitation, backdoor, and rouge access discovery, for defenders.

DTFTB allows a system defender to quickly and precisely locate common backdoor tendencies and system misconfigurations used by an attacker to maintain access.

Additionally DTFTB provide automated access-denial tools, that prohibit the introduction of new backdoors to a system.

DTFTB is primarily geared towards CTF or other competitive environments.
